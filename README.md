# AutomationExam

1. This solution developed in C # contains two projects:
- ShoppingInEbayFunctionalTest: Contains the main method that will execute the automated test.
- ShoppingInEbayFunctionalTest.Core: Contains the logic as the solution was built, in addition to the automated script.

2. To run the script:
The ShoppingInEbayFunctionalTest -> bin -> Debug -> ShoppingInEbayFunctionalTest.exe project must be accessed. This .exe file will execute the automated script.

3. In the 'Selenium' folder you will find the automated script in .json format (If you want to open it you can do it with VS Code)
